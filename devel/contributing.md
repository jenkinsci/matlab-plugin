## Contributing to This Plugin

First, familiarize yourself with [Jenkins Plugin Release Using GitHub Actions](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-cd/).

To contribute to this plugin, create a new branch. Make your code changes on this new branch.

Verify changes by running tests and building locally with this command:

```
mvn verify
```

Once your changes are verified and CI pipeline checks and tests have passed, create a pull request.

Once your pull request has been approved, merge the branch to the main branch. Then, create a new release by running the [cd.yaml](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matlab-plugin/actions/workflows/cd.yaml) file. The release appears on the [Releases](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matlab-plugin/releases) page. On that page, review the autogenerated release notes and update them as needed.
